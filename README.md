# light-tensor framework (l-ten)

### Low overhead framework for fast neural network training
### Fast and efficient inference in production
### Faster than libtorch (the C++ backend for PyTorch)
### Quick turn-around on network architecture and hyper-parameter search


#### Features
- Auto differentiation
- Popular network layer types
- Popular optimizers
- Similar API to libtorch
- int8 quantization (linear layer only for now)
- Python frontend coming soon

#### Demos
- Build the l-tensor library and run tests
- UAV dynamics simulator

#### Benchmarks
- l-ten vs libtorch training and inference (MNIST)
- l-ten vs libtorch training and infernece (Speech Commands)
