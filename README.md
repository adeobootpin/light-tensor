### Low overhead framework for fast neural network training and inference
### Faster than libtorch (the C++ backend for PyTorch)
### Quick turn-around on network architecture and hyper-parameter search

#### Features
- Auto differentiation

- Popular network layer types

- Popular optimizers

- Similar API to libtorch

- int8 quantization (linear layer only for now)

- Python frontend coming soon
